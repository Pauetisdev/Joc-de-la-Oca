# Joc de l'Oca (Game of the Goose)

This is a simple Java **board game app** based on the traditional *Game of the Goose*, with a graphical user interface (GUI).

## About
The project is a digital version of the classic board game "Joc de l'Oca".  
It allows two players to play using a simple visual interface where the dice, players, and board are shown on screen.  
The goal is to reach the last square by rolling the dice and avoiding special tiles that can move you forward or backward.

## Features
- Two players take turns.
- Random dice rolls (1–6).
- Colorful graphical interface (no console needed).
- Player pieces move automatically on the board.
- Special squares with effects (jump ahead, go back, etc.).
- The winner is displayed when someone reaches the last square.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pauetisdev/Joc-de-la-Oca.git
2. Open the project in your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

3. Build and run the application.

4. The game window will open — no console required.
## Future Ideas
- Add more special squares (Bridge, Well, Maze, Prison...).
- Support more than two players.
- Add sound effects and animations.
- Add save/load game options.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** JavaFX (Graphical User Interface)  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
